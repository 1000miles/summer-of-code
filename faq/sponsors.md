###{#vat-taxes} What about VAT and tax deduction for my donations?

We don't really know about tax laws everywhere in the world but according to
our tax advisor: "Contributions and payments to Rails Girls Summer of Code are
not deductible as charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes.
However, they may be deductible under other provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code (for US) or your local tax authority's advice."

A word about VAT. Sorry to bother you - we'll keep a long story short. If
you're not from Europe (to be precise - from the EU) you can skip this. For all
the others: we have to struggle with the odd EU VAT regulations for the above
mentioned packages. While you fill out the form and entered an EU country we
will show a field to ask for your VAT ID. If you have one please enter it -
otherwise your contribution will be reduced by 19% VAT. You come from Germany?
We will show you a field to ask if VAT is a recoverable tax for you. If so, we
will add the 19% VAT to your contribution and ask you to complete your address
data.

###{#unknown} Question answered here?

Summer of Code will offer a reduced amount of spots to students. We currently
account for raising 5000 USD per student. E.g. if we raise 30,000 USD we will
have enough budget to fund 6 students.

###{#rgsoc-cancelled} What happens if you don't reach your goal or RGSoC gets cancelled?

If for some reason the Summer of Code can't go ahead as planned, donors will be
offered a refund of their donation. Alternatively you can decide to have your
donation go to the Rails Girls organization to share your donation with other,
future Rails Girls events across the globe.

###{#left-over-budget} What happens to any left-over budget from the 2013 Summer of Code?

Any money left over from the campaign will be saved for next year's Rails Girls
Summer of Code. Should there be no Summer of Code in 2015, the Rails Girls
organization will decide how to best spend any left over donation money on
other non-profit initiatives.
