            <p id="more-options">If you have applied and your team is not on this list - don’t worry. That does
            not mean your summer can’t be a Summer of Code! Here is what you can do:</p>
        </article>

        <article class="content">
            <p><strong>1) Join the program as a volunteering student / team</strong></p>

            <p>If you want to work on your project without monetary support, then please tell
            us. We will automatically accept you into the program and you’ll get all the
            benefits like access to remote support chat rooms, supervision, visibility to
            the community etc.</p>

            <p><strong>2) Cross your fingers</strong></p>

            <p>We are trying to raise more money for the campaign and hope that we will be able
            to offer some extra last-minute slots. If we have sufficient budget, we will do
            another selection round next week.</p>

            <p>Please tell us if there’s a deadline on which you’d need to be notified at the
            latest so you can still start working on your project on July 1st (some of you
            might need extra time to prepare).</p>

            <p>Also, if you were planning to work on a project that was also chosen by a team
            from the ones listed above, please update your application.</p>

            <p><strong>3) Get involved with your local communities</strong></p>

            <p>If you don’t want to stick to a strict coding program, but want to continue
            getting more into code, we can help you form project groups for coding, find
            user groups, organize Hackdays, Summer Camps etc. If you get in touch we will
            try connect you and help with this.</p>
