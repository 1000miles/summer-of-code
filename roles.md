Rails Girls Summer of Code is run by a community of volunteers, and supported
by companies.

During the program people take on the following roles.


#### Main Roles

Rails Girls Summer of Code centers around teams. An ideal team has a pair of
students, one or more coaches and a project expert, called mentor.

##### Student

Students obviously are the main characters in this program. They work on Open
Source projects fulltime during summer, ideally in pairs. Everyone else on the
program is doing their best to support them.

Students also are the only ones who get paid by the program itself.

##### Coach

Coaches are developers who work closely with their students. They help their
students to learn and accomplish their project tasks on a daily basis.

Ideally students and coaches share the same office space.

Since coaching takes time, coaches often will team up and take turns. Sometimes
companies will allow employees to spend a limited amount of time on coaching
during business hours.

Coaches do not have to be experts on the team's project, but they need to

* be able to support their student's learning process
* be skilled to understand the project and the mentor's directions

Should a coach not be available to help with an issue, students can also reach
out to remote coaches (see below).


##### Mentor

Mentors are experts on the Open Source project the team is working on. Ideally
they are decision makers, or work closely with decision makers, so they can set
general goals, give directions and provide feedback.

Since students will be supported by coaches in their day-to-day work, the
workload for mentors is limited. This said, mentors can also assume the role of
a coach themselves.


#### Support Roles

Teams will mostly work autonomously and self-dependently, but they will also
be supported by others.


##### Remote Coach

Remote Coaches are available for help in a central, public chatroom.


##### Supervisor

Every team will be assigned a supervisor. Supervisors touch base with their
teams regularly to see how their team is doing, and if there's anything the
team needs help with.

Usually a supervisor's work means to check the team's work progress (see
the [Team log](/team-log)), motivate and cheer them up.

In rare cases there may be the need to escalate issues to the organizers
team, e.g. when a team has stopped working.

A supervisor can be responsible for more than one team and it is indeed
encouraged to minimize the organizational overhead.


##### Organizer

The organizers team takes care of running the program as a whole. They
make sure everything runs smoothly, sponsors are happy and the world gets
to know about the amazing progress the student teams make.


#### Other Roles

##### Sponsors

By donating money to this program but most of the time not being involved
actively sponsors take on a supporting actors role, but quite obviously a very
importing one: They essentially pay for students so they are able to
participate in this program.

##### Coaching Companies

With this role we are trying to formalize a very successful concept from last
year: Companies that fully host a students team and allow employees to coach
them. You can find out more about this here: [Coaching Companies](/coaching-companies).
