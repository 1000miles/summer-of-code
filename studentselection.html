            <p>Student registrations for Rails Girls Summer of Code are open! We now invite all women to apply for the program who:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>attended at least one Rails Girls or similar Ruby introduction workshop.</li>
                <li>expanded their Ruby skills after the workshop in a study group or independently by working on a Ruby project.</li>
                <li>can spend at least two and ideally three months this summer working on the project.</li>
                <li>have found another student to pair up with and a coach (we can help with that).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An ideal group to apply would consist of two students (who will both be paid) and one or more coaches (who won't be paid).</p>
            <h3>How will this work?</h3>
            <h4>1. Find a pair and a coach</h4>
            <p>Before you can apply to the Rails Girls Summer of Code you need to find</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a coach that is able to support you throughout the project as well as,</li>
                <li>ideally, another student who you'd pair-program with.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is not a requirement to find a pair, but you will have a higher chance of being accepted.</p>
            <p>Coaches should have sufficient time throughout the project in order to support you well: at least a few hours per week, more in the beginning of the project, probably less near the end. If they're not able to do this alone it is fine if coaches team up.</p>
            <p>Talk to them and figure out how to make sure that throughout the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have a good place to work (ideally a desk next to your coach).</li>
                <li>They can support you well and have enough time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The best starting point for finding a pair and coach is to contact your local Rails Girls and Ruby communities. Ask on the Rails Girls Summer of Code community mailing list. Ask on Twitter.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for finding your pair and coach, but we will do our best to help!</p>

            <h4>2. Submit your application with your pair and coach</h4>
            <p>Please meet with coach and pair. You should feel comfortable working with them closely for 3 months.</p>
            <p>Together with you coaches are supposed to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>interview you about the level of your expertise and;</li>
                <li>make recommendations and preferences about projects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once all of you have made sure that you meet the requirements you can submit your application.</p>
            <h4>Selection VERSION A (ranking)</h4>
            <p>We will make ensure that all the applications meet all the requirements.</p>
            <p>The goal of Rails Girls Summer of Code is to get you in touch with the Open Source community and allow you to take your first steps in contributing to it. This will be a learning process for you. But we also want to make sure that you have a good chance at succeeding with this.</p>
            <p>Therefore we will favour applications based on these criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you are women.</li>
                <li>you have a sufficient experience level.</li>
                <li>you can do 3 months rather than less.</li>
                <li>your coach has enough time available to guide you.</li>
                <li>you have a pair.</li>
                <li>you've been picked by a project maintainer.</li>
                <li>your coach works at a sponsor's company.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The committee will rank your application based on these criteria. Applications that meet them the most will make it in.</p>
            <p>If we end up with more suitable students than places, we will draw.</p>
