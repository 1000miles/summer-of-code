Good news on a Monday and we want you to know it first:

**There will be a Rails Girls Summer of Code 2014!** Yay!

Do you want to join our organizing team as a helper? Wonderful! We are happy about every helping hand: Shoot an email to [summer-of-code@railsgirls.com](mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com) and let's get the magic started. 

We will release more infos soon, so stay tuned!

P.S. Remember last year? Here is one of our favorite videos from Team Species+
