After 60 hours of rating ~100 applications for 7 spots, we now are proud to say: we made the first step. We selected the first 7 teams and will let them know throughout the day via email and ask if they accept. BUT this means, we still have 3 seats for teams left, that could be accepted, given that we fund them.

We are currently at 73 k, that means we still need 17k to fund those last seats. So please help us fund them and make us able to take on three other wonderful teams, and make their dreams of a summer of code come true. 

In short: If you haven't heard from us: Don't lose hope. We still have 3 team spots left! So let's [help fund them](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) and start another summer with 10 awesome teams!
