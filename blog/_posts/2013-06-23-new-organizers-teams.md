Got some spare time and a knack for PR, community management, Sponsoring or Coding? Awesome!  
We could use some helpful hands and can offer a wonderful summer of experience ;)

Part of the reason is that [Sven] (https:twitter.com/svenfuchs) will have to step back from working on Rails
Girls Summer of Code a little bit starting July and focussing on [Travis] (http://travis.org)
again. During the first weeks he will still be available about half-time and
[Anika] (twitter.com/langziehohr) will continue to be available full-time, sponsored by Travis.

These teams would love to have you:

### 1. Campaign and Sponsors management

Sponsors need to be paid special attention to until after the program as much
as possible â€¦ eventually they're the ones who allow us to pay so many people!

Tasks: build a concept and list of things that we can be done to make
sponsors happy (we've got a bunch of ideas), then implement these throughout
the program.


### 2. Helpdesk and Team Supervision

The idea is to organize remote support
(answering questions on IRC etc) for when teams get stuck and local coaches
aren't available.

Tasks: build a concept and list of things that can be done to ensure
teams have sufficient support and issues are being taken care of. Also:
encourage teams to connect witch each other and have fun on the channels :)


### 3. Blog, Newsletter and Press

This team writes up news in order to keep our community in the loop, and tell
the world about the program.

Tasks: come up with a concept and list of things that need to be written and
published, then implement this.


### 4. Website

This team takes care of the website and makes sure it stays up to date with the
progress of the project.
The team is still looking for someone with design skills and others who'd
like to help out. Is that you? :)


### 5. Teams App

The app should be mostly done before July, but might need updating once in a
while.

Sven can still take care of this for the time being, but it would be cool if
someone with solid Rails dev skills could take this over. 


If you'd like to help ping us here [RailsGirlsSoC](http://twitter.com/railsgirlssoc) or here
[community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/groups/rails-girls-summer-of-code-community)

There will not only be lots and lots of karma points, but also love, shared cat-gifs and possibly cake for helping out ;)
Let's get this started:
