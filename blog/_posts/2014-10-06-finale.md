It's real. We can't believe it, it's been such a wonderful journey. These were the last days of the Summer of Code!

The program came official to an end as of the 30th of September, so we took a few days to think about the things we enjoyed most about this year’s proceedings. We asked the people behind RGSoC to take some selfies to share their favorite moment/lesson/thing of their summer or a message for you.

### If not me, then who

It’s the spirit of working together as a community that reminds us why we make RGSoC happen, because the program is not simply willed into existence by magical powers - although this sounds awesome. It is through the hard and dedicated work of organisers, supervisors and everybody else behind the scenes. Coaches, Mentors and Helpdeskers, and of course the financial support from sponsors and the wider community and last but not least the Travis Foundation. All of these people are the magical spark who made this fairy tale come true again. 

Emma Watson put it very eloquently in her speech for the launch of the ally-campaign #HeforShe a few weeks ago. *“If not me, then who? If not now, then when?”*

Because all the people behind RGSoC said *"It's going to be me."*, they deserve no less than a standing ovation. Each and every one of them.

### 32 new beginnings

With the help of the wonderful community we raised $95 k, and with that money we were able to provide sponsorship to 10 teams - that's 20 participants. We also had 6 amazing volunteer teams this year, wich takes us to 32 students in total.  [32 stories to tell](http://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/), 32 new beginnings.

The teams worked on projects e.g. Rubinius, Spree, Bundler, Diaspora*, BrowserSpree CMS, Speakerinnen, Species+, created a tool for documentation testing or started a migraine tracker - to only name a few. 


### Something to remember the summer

To fight against a possible post-summer-of-code-blues, we began to create a Mixtape dedicated to this year's RGSoC. And we want your song to be on it. Which song made your summer? Just [tweet to us](https://twitter.com/railsgirlssoc) the link to your song on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) and it's going to be part of this mixtape. 

[https://soundcloud.com/railsgirlssummerofcode/sets/rails-girls-summer-of-code](https://soundcloud.com/railsgirlssummerofcode/sets/rails-girls-summer-of-code)

This is something to remember the summer by. To listen to and rock your code. No post-RGSoC-blues. Enjoy! Because these last days are not the end, they are the beginning of 32 new stories.
