We are hackers who believe strongly in RailsGirls Summer of Code, and to help raise money to get the last 3 teams
(or more!) sponsored, we hacked together http://givie.io.

It’s a pretty simple concept: you create a campaign, decide on a fun pledge you would be willing to do 
if you get enough backers, and BAM! Start spreading the word. Givie redirects your supporters to the 
RailsGirls Summer of Code site, and after they’ve donated there, the number of backers on your campaign gets updated.

The idea for Givie came from Duana’s personal campaign last year when she promised to go one month without 
coffee if she could get 20 people to donate to RailsGirls Summer of Code. For someone whose twitter name 
is <a href="http://twitter.com/@starkcoffee">@starkcoffee</a>, this was something people were curious to see. 
We created <a href="http://givie.io>Givie</a> so that we we can scale this idea!

Duana sent this tweet out a few weeks ago, and fellow Australians-in-Berlin-who-support-RailsGIrls Marc and Sara 
answered the call:
