Some of our teams are still rocking their projects, some have already finished, but this doesn't mean the coding needs to be over. There are some opportunities! We got offers for internships from companies: For example 
[opsworks](http://aws.amazon.com/de/opsworks/) or [and-is](http://www.and-is.de/) a.k.a. Aupair World  offered each 2 spots. Which is pret-ty cool! 

###Stundents

If you are interested these two, drop us a line!
Also - and this is the important part - please rock on and start looking for opportunities. Be active!
We are more than happy to get you in touch with one of our most wonderful sponsors, just let us know. We will try to help you in any way to turn your summer into something more!
