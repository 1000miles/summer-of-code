The Rails Girls Summer of Code crowdfunding campaign is officially open! And you
thought that christmas only came ONCE a year! ;) We're opening up our campaign
page to the wider public today, so spread the word!

[Get on over to our crowd funding page](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/)!

### No donation is too little!

Over the last two years we've learned quite a lot about how to run a global fellowship
program, and now we're back to do it all again!

One thing that has stayed consistent since the program was founded in 2013 changes, however,
is the generous support (both financially and otherwise) of the programming and technology
community to make such an ambitious project a reality.

Whether you have a little, or a whole lot to give, every cent raised makes a huge difference to
creating a bigger more expansive program in 2015.


### Some stats on what you helped us achieve last year

In 2013 we took on 33 students, to a total of 27 coaches. In 2014, our students numbered
32 to 45 coaches. Since 2013, the Rails Girls Summer of Code teams have contributed to 27
unique projects


About 90% of the students who went through the Summer of Code since 2013 are still
working in the tech sector.

Last year we raised $__, with the help of you and our amazing sponsors. Help us
get even further this year!


### Want help out in other ways?
