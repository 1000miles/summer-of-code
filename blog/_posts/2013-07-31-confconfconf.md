You sent us your [wish lists](https://twitter.com/search?q=rgsocconfs&src=typd)
and the conference raffle fairy (a.k.a. Sven) has coded (a lot) to make a raffle and we made our brains fume by thinking about how to do it the best way and heeeeere you can see how winners are made:

Congratulations! We are so greateful for the wonderful people organizing the conferences for pulling some tickets out of their magic hats. Also we couldn't be more happy for you:
You get to go to fantastic conferences and even meet other RGSoC students and rock these conference days!
(Oh, how we wish, we could be there too and see you all spread your wings and fly into the coder community - but we hope, you'll keep us in the loop and tell the world how your first conferences have been)

If you want to look in our cards, you can see the logic behind all this here LINK  To sum up: We made sure, that everybody who applied got a ticket and nobody came away empty-handed. Here is the full list of all winners. 
Congratulations, you lucky, lucky students!
