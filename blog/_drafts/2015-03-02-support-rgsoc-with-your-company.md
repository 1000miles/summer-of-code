We are getting closer and closer to student application frenzy, and there is still so much to get done! It's helpful that spring is not quite ready to show up yet - cold temperatures are the best cure against procrastination (sometimes).

We love making things easy for our supporters, which is why on top of having rewritten all of the guides during those long winter nights, we've also compiled a list to help you help us make the upcoming RGSoC great! Here are a few ideas to get you started.


### Sponsoring  
*Making it all possible*  
Just like last year, we have several sponsoring packages for you to choose from: tiny to bombastic, we've got it all. Perks for sponsorships include having your swag in the care packages we send to all of of teams, your logo on our presentation slides and website, a mention in our Hall of Fame page, and mentions in our tweets, facebook posts and on the blog! Of course, being an early bird sponsor will qualify for some extra buzz, as your logo will already be on our page when the crowdfunding campaign madness starts. If you are interested in a sponsoring slot for the Rails Girls Summer of Code 2015, you can find all the detailed information [here](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/sponsorship).

### Partners  
*Like sponsors, but different*  
Outside of the monthly stipend itself, we also try to enable learning for our accepted students during and after the Summer of Code. And what better way to learn than to be part of a study group, to read books on interesting new topics, or to join an online class? In the previous editions of the Rails Girls Summer of Code, we've been very lucky to find partners in the form of conferences, online learning platforms, book publishers, and the like, who offered what they do best: conference tickets, vouchers for free classes, and great free books to keep the learning going. We know that education can come in the most diverse form, and we welcome any offer or partnership that we feel will help our teams get the best out of their learning experience. Willing to commit to leading a study group for a year? Got a special deal on educational material for our teams? We want it all! Read more about it in the sponsor section, under [partners](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/sponsorship).

### Coaching Companies  
*Our hidden gems*  
Working from home can be hard and distracting, and coaching companies can give students the possibility to work in a safe and exciting environment by offering desk space and coaches. It's a great deal, because in most cases, students will be able to take part in stand-up meetings, learn more about company culture, and will always have a coach available to them. It also puts less pressure on the coaches if there is a pool of developers directly available within the company, and if they can partly use business hours to help their team out; and finally, the companies will have possible future developers already at hand.  
The way it works: the company should reach out to possible students in their area (we also encourage students who want to apply to look for local companies) before the student application, after which they should register themselves and their coaches in our teams app. This is important, because it allows the teams to mention they have a coaching company backing them. After we go through the selection process, we will notify the teams, and their companies, if they've been accepted.   
There will always be the risk that a team will not be selected in spite of their have a coaching company on board, as we select teams based on their application and skills only. Should you desperately want your team to be part of the program, they can still apply as volunteer teams, and/or you can cover their costs over the summer. There are many ways in which the coaching company scenario can work, so we suggest you head over to the [guide](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching-company) to read more, or reach out to us directly.

### Supporters  
*all the other ways to help*  
In the past, we have also had people on our core team being supported by their own companies to work on Rails Girls Summer of Code issues and tasks, such as main coordination, dev and design work on our website or teams app, supervising teams, and so on. This is a great way to support us, because there is always a lot to do for the RGSoC (and a lot of the work can be done remotely).  

Hopefully, we have given you a couple of ideas to support us this summer. If all else fails - there's always our crowdfunding campaign, which we will open up very, very soon! Stay tuned!
