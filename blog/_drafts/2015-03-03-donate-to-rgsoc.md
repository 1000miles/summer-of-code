## The Crowdfunding campaign is officially open!

And you thought that christmas only came ONCE a year!

We're opening up our crowd funding to the wider public today!


### No donation is too little!

Over the last two years we've learned quite a lot about trying to run such an ambitious program.

One thing that never changes, however, is the generous support (both financially and otherwise)
of the programming and technology community to make our ambitious goals a reality.

Whether you have a little, or a whole lot to give, every cent raised makes a huge difference to
creating a bigger more expansive program in 2015.


So without further ado, [get on over to our crowd funding page](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/)!


### Some stats on what you helped us achieve last year

2014:

students: 32
coaches: 45

### What if I want to help out in other ways?

Take a look our about page for more info about how to get involved with Summer of Code, as a coach, mentor,
and/or supervisor.
