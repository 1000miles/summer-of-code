The Rails Girls Summer of Code crowdfunding campaign
is officially open! And you
thought that christmas only came ONCE a year! ;) We're opening up our campaign
page to the wider public today, so spread the word and
[donate](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/)!



### No amount is too little!

Over the last two years we've learned quite a lot about how to run a global fellowship
program. However, one thing has always been consistent; the generous support (both financial and otherwise) of the programming and technology community.

Whether you have a little, or a whole lot to give, every cent raised makes a huge difference to
creating a bigger and more expansive program in 2015.

If you want to sponsor a larger amount, take a look at our [sponsor packages](/sponsors/packages)
 and [guidelines](/sponsorship-guidelines).


### Want to help out in other ways?

If you are the maintainer of an open source project, please consider [submitting it](/guide/projects)
 to our list!
A developer looking for a way to use your coding powers for good? Find out more
 about [coaching a team](/guide/coaching)?

If you are an organizer whose conference is on during or after the northern Summer of 2015,
why not offer a ticket to your event for our 'ticket giveaway'. [Read about the
awesome conferences that donated tickets last year!](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2014-06-09-conference-tickets/)

Have a number of other super powers you think we need? Take a look at our [about page](/about) for more
info about how to get involved.
