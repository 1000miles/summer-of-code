                        <h1>Women go Open Source!</h1>
                        <p>RailsGirls Summer of Code is a project that aims at lowering the barriers for students of newcomer workshops to participate in Open Source projects.</p>
                        <p>Following the footsteps of Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code students will be paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Open Source projects set goals and name mentors. Coaches help students to get started, keep motivated and be successful.</p>
                        <p>Unlike those programs the RailsGirls Summer of Code is not about pushing sophisticated, high-end code that very few people code write. It is about lowering barriers, connecting people, motivating newcomers and raising diversity.</p>
                        <p>We are currently aiming at projects running up to three months.<p>

                        <h2>Do you run an Open Source project?</h2>
                        <p>Please consider registering <a href="project.html" title="register as an Open Source project">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>Any project is elegible as long as it's open source.</p>
                        <p>Possible goals can be anything from adding features and writing actual code to improving the documentation to doing html/css or design work. It doesn't need to be "just code", instead it actually might help if students could bring in their background (if they're designers, do some design work, if they're good at writing, write something, etc.)</p>
                        <p>Also, consider setting a number of small goals or follow-up goals so you can adjust to students if need be.</p>
                        <p>Please name a (main) mentor who's up to support the student throughout the project. Projects might share work on this and have "secondary mentors" but there should be one, main personal mentor.</p>

                        <h2>Are you a coach?</h2>
                        <p>Please consider registering <a href="coach.html" title="register as a coach">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>You should bring enough time to support the student throughout the project. Ideally you'd be able to provide a workplace throughout the project, so the student you're coaching can work on-site, next to you.</p>
