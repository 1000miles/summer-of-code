<h1 id="teams">Teams</h1>

<p>Rails Girls Summer of Code centers around teams. An ideal team has a pair of
students, one or more coaches and a project expert, called a mentor. Here's what they do:</p>

<h2 id="teams_student">Student</h2>

<p>Students, obviously, are the main characters in this program. They work on Open
Source projects full-time, from July-September. Every other role at Rails Girls Summer of Code is dedicated to supporting these students in completing their projects, and generally having a great learning experience.</p>

<p>Students also are the <strong>only</strong> people who will be remunerated if accepted into the Summer of Code</p>

<h2 id="teams_coach">Coach</h2>

<p>Coaches are developers who work closely with their students. They help their
students to learn and accomplish their project tasks on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Ideally students and coaches share the same office space.</p>

<p>Since coaching can take up a lot of time, coaches will often team up and roster themselves to students. Sometimes
companies will allow employees to spend a pre-determined amount of time on coaching
during business hours.</p>

<p>Coaches do not have to be experts on the team's Open Source project, but they need to;</p>
<ul>
    <li>be able to support their student's learning process</li>
    <li>be skilled to understand the project and the mentor's directions</li>
</ul>

<p>Should a coach not be available to help with an issue, students can also reach
out to remote coaches (see below). Coaches can also be mentors, which is explained below.</p>

<h2 id="teams_mentor">Mentor</h2>

Mentors are experts on the Open Source project the team is working on. Ideally
they are decision makers, or work closely with decision makers, so they can set
general goals, give directions and provide feedback.

Since students will be supported by coaches in their day-to-day work, the
workload for mentors is limited. This said, mentors can also assume the role of
a coach themselves.

<h1 id="support">Support and Organization</h1>
<p>These roles take care of running the program as a whole, as well as on team progress. If Summer of Code is a play, the organizers and support roles are directing, painting sets, sewing costumes, stocking the catering cart, casting the roles, doing up the play bills.</p>


<h2 id="support_remote_coach">Remote Coach</h2>
<p>Remote Coaches are available for help in a central, public chatroom.</p>


<h2 id="support_supervisor">Supervisor</h2>
<p>Every team will be assigned a supervisor. Supervisors touch base with their
teams regularly to see how their team is doing, and if there's anything the
team needs help with.</p>

<p>Usually a supervisor's work means checking up on the team's work progress (see
the [Team log](/team-log)), as well as generally motivating them through the rough coding patches they will inevitably experience.</p>

<p>In rare cases there may be the need to escalate issues to the organizers
team, e.g. when a team has stopped working.</p>

<p>A supervisor can be responsible for more than one team and is
encouraged to ease to organizational workload.</p>


<h2 id="support_organizer">Organizer</h2>
<p>Organizers are a pretty multi-skilled bunch. They are developers, designers, content writers, community manager and business owners all volunteering their time. They keep the website up, sponsors rolling in, and generally keeping everything rolling. Organizers are the ones who answer your emails, select applicants, monitor the social feeds and generally contribute their unique skill set to an aspect of the organizational workload.</p>

<h1 id="financial">Financial</h1>
<p>Without the financial support of generous (and also incredibly amazing) donors, Rails Girls Summer of Code simply could not take place! Here's to the bacon-makers!</p>


<h2 id="financial_sponsor">Sponsors</h2>
<p>Sponsors make it possible for Rails Girls Summer of Code to create a paid program for participants. Sponsors are sourced from all over the world, and represent an entire cross section of industry. While Sponsors receive a great deal of publicity and public exposure in return for their generous donations (usually a package) but most of the time not being involved
actively sponsors take on a supporting actors role, but quite obviously a very
importing one: They essentially pay for students so they are able to
participate in this program.</p>

<h2 id="financial_coaching_company">Coaching Companies</h2>
<p>This role is a formalization of a very successful concept from last
year: Companies that fully host a students team for the duration of their project and allow employees to coach
them. You can find out more about this initiative here: [Coaching Companies](/coaching-companies). Sponsors can be coaching companies too, as well as vice versa</p>

<h2 id="financial_you">You</h2>
<p>Our crowd funding campaign is vitally important to Summer of Code. Your donation goes directly to participants, and makes a big difference to how many can be accepted. If your company can't sponsor an entire package, they can still donate via our crowd sourcing campaign.</p>
