## Sponsor Packages

Rails Girls Summer of Code will pay selected students 1500 USD per month for a
three months period, so they can dedicate themselves to their Open Source
projects full-time. As a sponsor, you will be crucial to make that happen.

Rails Girls Summer of Code is all about community. You will support it as a
global project, so your sponsorship will enter a budget pool from which
students will be paid.

* You will be listed on our [sponsors page](/sponsors) which will be linked
  to frequently (see last year's [sponsors page](http://2013.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/sponsors-thanks/)).
* We will include your swag to support packages which are sent out to all
  students during the summer (see below).
* Lots of tweet love from the community.

#### Silver, 2500 USD

We are looking forward to having you on board as a sponsor!


##### Your swag in student support packages

If you send us your swag (e.g. stickers, pens, notebooks or other things
that fit nicely with a Summer of Code learning project) we will include
it to a package that will be sent out to each student. Pictures of the
contents of these packages often are tweeted and retweeted a lot.

##### Your logo on slides at presentations about RGSoC

Students are strongly encourage to give full talks or lightning talks
at conferences (many of which donate free tickets for them) and/or
local programming and tech meetups, and present about their work. Some
organizers also present about the program as a whole.

They are asked to include a slide with all Gold and Platinum sponsor's
logos at the beginning of their presentation.
