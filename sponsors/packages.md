## Sponsorship Packages

Rails Girls Summer of Code helps bring more diversity into Open Source, by subsidising programming newcomers to work on an Open Source project of their choice. The program runs from July-September each year, and endows accepted students with USD1500 per month, for three months.

By providing this stipend, we enable students to dedicate themselves to their Open Source projects full-time, without the financial difficulties of taking time off work, or sacrificing a 'normal' job. As a sponsor, you are a crucial part of providing the Summer of Code subsidies.

Rails Girls Summer of Code is all about community. Your sponsorship will enter a global budget pool, from which the selected students will be paid.

If you want to help to support our participants have a life-altering Summer in Open Source (or Winter if you're in the Southern Hemisphere), we have a number of package you can choose from.

#### Your swag in student support packages

If you send us your swag (e.g. stickers, pens, notebooks or other things
that fit nicely with a Summer of Code learning project), we will include
it in a 'care package' that will be sent out to each student. Pictures of the
contents of these packages often are tweeted and retweeted a lot.

#### Your logo on slides at presentations about RGSoC

Students are strongly encourage to give full talks or lightning talks
at conferences (many of which donate free tickets for them) as well as
local programming and tech meetups. Students tend to present their projects at these meetups, and how Summer of Code is helping them do it. Some
organizers also present about the Summer of Code program as a whole.

All people presenting on behalf of or in conjunction with Summer of Code, are asked to include a slide with all Gold and Platinum sponsors'
logos at the beginning of their presentation.
