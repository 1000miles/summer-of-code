## Sponsorship Packages

Rails Girls Summer of Code subsidises programming newcomers to learn and work
on Open Source projects from July to September each year, and endows accepted
students with USD 1500 per month, for three months.

By providing this stipend, we enable students to dedicate themselves to their
Open Source learning projects full-time. As a sponsor, you are a crucial part of
providing the Summer of Code subsidies. Your sponsorship will enter a budget
pool, from which the selected students will be paid.

Sponsoring Rails Girls Summer of Code will make you feel warmer than a
unicorn's belly, and fuzzier than the fuzziest tribble!

But in all seriousness, warm fuzzies are just one nice side-effect you get.
During and even after the program you may experience severe amounts of organic
PR and marketing without having to lift a finger. The program sees a huge
amount of publicity from our student teams, coaches and organisers: be it on
Twitter, Facebook, blogs or at conferences and local developers meet ups. Itâ€™s
a great blend of marketing, and genuinely contributing to the development
community.

#### Your swag in student support packages

If you send us your swag (e.g. stickers, pens, notebooks or other things
that fit nicely with a Summer of Code learning project), we will include
it in a "care package" that will be sent out to each student. Pictures of the
contents of these packages often are tweeted and retweeted a lot.

#### Your logo on slides at presentations about RGSoC

Students are strongly encourage to give full talks or lightning talks at
conferences (many of which donate free tickets for them) as well as local
programming and tech meetups. Students tend to present their projects at these
meetups, and how Summer of Code is helping them do it. Some organizers also
present about the Summer of Code program as a whole.

All people presenting on behalf of or in conjunction with Summer of Code, are
asked to include a slide with all Gold and Platinum sponsors'
logos at the beginning of their presentation.

#### Your logo on our Hall of Fame

Starting this year we will list information about each year's instalment
on a "Hall of Fame" page: Teams participating, projects completed, success
stories to be told. This page will also include each year's Platinum (and
bigger) sponsors.
