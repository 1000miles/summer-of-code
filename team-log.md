## The Team Log

We'd like you to keep a log of short, daily status updates for your team for
the following purposes:

* It helps greatly with self-reflection.
* It helps to give an overview of what each of the teams is doing.

In development teams there's a common practice of doing standup
meetings in the morning. In these meetings everyone very briefly tells the
rest of the team what they did the day before, what they are going to work on
that day, and what issues they are facing (so others can help).

We recommend you write your log updates at the end of your work day. During the day we suggest keeping a list of keywords about your work throughout the day. This will help you remember things very quickly when you write about them in the evening.
Since you keep a log as a team, this will also help you share the work between you.

### What goes in a team log?

Your log updates should, at least, answer the question *"What have I done?"* in
a brief fashion. That could just be bullet points like *"Set up Homebrew on
our computers so we could install Postgres"*.

Of course, feel free to go into more detail, or answer the questions *"What are we going
to do tomorrow?"* and *"What issues do we need help with?"*, but
don't spend too much time on making things pretty. It really shouldn't take more
than 5-10 minutes to write this entry.

Please keep this log in an application that has a publicly accessible RSS or
Atom feed (from which we need the URL). Typically that could be a blog.
We will use the feed to aggregate updates from all teams in a central place.

Because this should be a list of short, pragmatic daily updates you might
not want to use your personal blog for this. We recommend setting up a new, separate blog instead.

### Why keep a team log?

First and foremost a log helps you to learn and reflect on your work and
learning experience. Fewer things will slip your memory and after a month or
two you'll remember more clearly what you've done.

We will aggregate all the team log entries, creating a
stream of activity across all teams, which we think will be useful because:

* We hope it encourages you to explore what other teams are doing, and comment
  or possibly even help out. In the end we'd like you to be in touch with the
  community, and currently you're part of the community of Rails Girls Summer of
  Code teams :)

* This resource will also help us to do some basic supervision and catch
  situations where teams are having issues, so we can find people to help.
  Obviously this won't usually be required because each team already has a
  fantastic local support network. But we think it's good to have an extra safety
  net.

* Also, quite a few sponsors have asked what we have in place for
  "quality management". We've pointed at the different levels of support we are offering in order to make sure every team has the  best chance to succeed. The daily log updates are an important part of this.


### What now?

Once you've set up your blog/application please add the feed URL to your team profile in the [RGSoC Teams App](http://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/).

And if something's not clear, or you have any questions about what you need to do, please let us know: [summer-of-code@railsgirls.com](mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com)
