      <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code will pay the selected students 1500 USD per month for a three months period, so they can dedicate themselves to their Open Source projects full-time. As a sponsor, you will be crucial to make that happen.</p>
      <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is all about the community. You will support it as a global project, so your sponsorship will enter a budget pool from which the selected students will be paid.</p>
      <p>If you are willing to support us, here is what we offer:</p>

      <ul class="donation-plans" id="sponsoring">
