      <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code helps bring more diversity into Open Source, by subsidising programming newcomers to work on an Open Source project of their choice. The program runs from July-September each year, and endows accepted students with USD1500 per month, for three months.</p>
          
        <p>By providing this stipend, we enable students to dedicate themselves to their Open Source projects full-time, without the financial difficulties of taking time off work, or sacrificing a 'normal' job. As a sponsor, you are a crucial part of providing the Summer of Code subsidies.</p>
      <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is all about community. Your sponsorship will enter a global budget pool, from which the selected students will be paid.</p>
      <p>If you want to help to support our participants have a life-altering Summer in Open Source (or Winter if you're in the Southern Hemisphere), we have a number of package you can choose from.</p>

      {% include sponsor_packages.html %}

      <p>You can also contribute a <strong>custom amount</strong> through <a href="/campaign">our crowdfunding</a> campaign and be listed on our website.</p>

      <p>Logos and links on the website will be sorted by amount and date your sponsorship is confirmed. Please read the information on VAT and tax deductibility in the FAQ if you are contributing from within the EU and especially from Germany.</p>

      <p>We are also continuously working on additional ideas that haven't been finalized yet, such as cross-promotions with podcasters, newsletters and blogs. Please contact us if you have any creative promotional and PR ideas you would like to see associated with your sponsorship package.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions, comments, or don't feel this list quite represents what you have to offer, please get in touch: <a href="mailto: summer-of-code@railsgirls.com" title="mail to the sponsor-team">summer-of-code@railsgirls.com</a></p>
