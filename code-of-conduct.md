##{#purpose} 1.‭ ‬Purpose

A‭ ‬primary‭ ‬goal‭ ‬of‭ ‬Rails Girls Summer of Code ‬is‭ ‬to‭ ‬be‭ ‬inclusive‭ ‬to‭ ‬the‭ ‬all of‭ ‬our part-takers - participants, coaches, mentors, supervisors and everyone in the organizing team,‭ ‬with‭ ‬the‭ ‬most‭ ‬varied‭ ‬and‭ ‬diverse‭ ‬backgrounds‭ ‬possible.‭ ‬As‭ ‬such,‭ ‬we‭ ‬are‭ ‬committed‭ ‬to‭ ‬providing‭ ‬a‭ ‬friendly,‭ ‬safe‭ ‬and‭ ‬welcoming‭ ‬environment‭ ‬for‭ ‬all,‭ ‬regardless‭ ‬of‭ ‬gender,‭ ‬sexual‭ ‬orientation,‭ ‬ability,‭ ‬ethnicity,‭ ‬socioeconomic‭ ‬status,‭ ‬and‭ ‬religion‭ (‬or‭ ‬lack‭ ‬thereof‭)‬.‭

This‭ ‬code‭ ‬of‭ ‬conduct‭ ‬outlines‭ ‬our‭ ‬expectations‭ ‬for‭ ‬all‭ ‬those‭ ‬who‭ ‬participate‭ ‬in‭ ‬our‭ ‬community,‭ ‬as‭ ‬well‭ ‬as‭ ‬the‭ ‬consequences‭ ‬for‭ ‬unacceptable‭ ‬behavior.

We‭ ‬invite‭ ‬all‭ ‬those‭ ‬who‭ ‬participate‭ ‬in‭ ‬Rails Girls Summer of Code ‬to‭ ‬help‭ ‬us‭ ‬create‭ ‬safe‭ ‬and‭ ‬positive‭ ‬experiences‭ ‬for‭ ‬everyone.

##{#welcoming} 2.‎ ‏Welcoming environment

A‭ ‬supplemental‭ ‬goal‭ ‬of‭ ‬this‭ ‬Code‭ ‬of‭ ‬Conduct‭ ‬is‭ ‬to‭ ‬increase‭ ‬an open and welcoming environment‭‭ ‬by‭ ‬encouraging‭ ‬community‭ ‬participants‭ ‬to‭ ‬recognize‭ ‬and‭ ‬strengthen‭ ‬the‭ ‬relationships‭ ‬between‭ ‬our‭ ‬actions‭ ‬and‭ ‬their‭ ‬effects‭ ‬on‭ ‬our‭ ‬community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

##{#expected} 3.‎ ‏Expected‭ ‬Behavior

  * Participate‭ ‬in‭ ‬an‭ ‬supporting ‬and‭ ‬active‭ ‬way.‭ ‬In‭ ‬doing‭ ‬so,‭ ‬you‭ ‬contribute‭ ‬to‭ ‬the‭ ‬health‭ ‬and‭ ‬longevity‭ ‬of‭ ‬this‭ ‬community.
  * Exercise‭ ‬consideration‭ ‬and‭ ‬respect‭ ‬in‭ ‬your‭ ‬speech‭ ‬and‭ ‬actions.
  * Attempt‭ ‬collaboration‭ ‬before‭ ‬conflict.
  * Refrain‭ ‬from‭ ‬demeaning,‭ ‬discriminatory,‭ ‬or‭ ‬harassing‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬and‭ ‬speech.
  * Be‭ ‬mindful‭ ‬of‭ ‬your‭ ‬surroundings‭ ‬and‭ ‬of‭ ‬your‭ ‬fellow‭ ‬participants.‭ ‬Alert‭ ‬community‭ ‬leaders‭ ‬if‭ ‬you‭ ‬notice‭ ‬a‭ ‬dangerous‭ ‬situation,‭ ‬someone‭ ‬in‭ ‬distress,‭ ‬or‭ ‬violations‭ ‬of‭ ‬this‭ ‬Code‭ ‬of‭ ‬Conduct,‭ ‬even‭ ‬if‭ ‬they‭ ‬seem‭ ‬inconsequential.

##{#contact} 8.‎ ‏Contact and Trust Committee

We have set up a trust committee that consist of both people involved with organizing, and externals. You can contact the person you feel most comfortable reaching out to. By offering external contacts that are not involved in the project we want to make sure that if you have problems with people involved in the organization, you have a safe contact to turn to. They will act as a mediator. The trust committee will leave your request anonymous (unless this is not an issue for you) and devote their time to fixing any issue you might have. This covers everything from feeling uncomfortable with somebody, having personal issues in your life you need help with, feeling bullied, misunderstood, discriminated against, disrespected etc.
