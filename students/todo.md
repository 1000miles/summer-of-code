<h1>Things To Do</h1>

The Rails Girls Summer of Code is about supporting the students on their way
into the Open Source community. Below, you find numerous activities that are part of the program. The suggestions and best practices from former years will help you set up a good working environment and support you in having a successful and fulfilling Summer of Code. 

Besides coding, the Rails Girls Summer of Code includes getting in touch with the community and spreading the word.

<h2 id="support-network">Your Support Network</h2>

The most important part in a community is the support people give to each other. Rails Girls Summer of Code provides a comprehensive support network that will help you and your team pair in all project related aspects.

**Coaches and Mentor**      
The core team will be you and your pair along with your coaches and the mentor of your Open Source project.

The coaches will work side by side with you during the program, explain coding steps, teach you troubleshooting skills and generally support you in your day-to-day programming work. During application time, coaches are supposed to assist you in finding a suitable project and project issues that fit your skill level. 

The project mentors are like the product owners of the Open Source project you'll work on. They have an insight on what issues need to be worked on and - at the same time - guide you in finding the right issues for you. 

Communication should always take place as a team so everyone is on the same side. Also, set up schedules for coaching times and calls with your mentor at the very beginning of the program! 


**Supervisor**      
Each team will have a supervisor who keeps an eye on the general well-being of the project's progress and assist you in the non-coding aspects of the Rails Girls Summer of Code. As such, the supervisor will keep in constant contact with you and will be the go-to person whenever you have a question or problem your coaches or mentor can't solve. 

Preferably, we'd like to have you hold weekly calls with your supervisor. At the beginning of the program, agree with your supervisor on a time and day for the weekly calls.


**Helpdesk**      
Sometimes your coaches won't be available, but that one code snippet just won't work. For these cases, we will provide a Helpdesk chat where developers will help you getting forward with your issue. 

As soon as we have setup the details for the Helpdesk, we'll post the link to it here. 

**All-Teams Communication**     
Since Rails Girls Summer of Code is a community event, we also want to connect the students amongst each other so they can share their experiences. We're currently in the process of figuring out a good way to do so without overwhelming you with too many channels to check on. As soon as we're good to go, we'll post updates here. So please bear with us :).

**Trust Committee**      
A primary goal of Rails Girls Summer of Code is to be inclusive to the all of our part-takers - participants, coaches, mentors, supervisors and everyone in the organizing team, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

We have a [Code of Conduct](/about/code-of-conduct) in place and will again set up a trust committee that consists of both people involved with organizing, and externals. You can contact the person you feel most comfortable reaching out to.

**Orga Team**      
And if all else fails, we are always here to support you. Send us an email at [mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com](summer-of-code@railsgirls.com) and we'll figure out the rest together. 

Now there's only one thing left to say: Use all the channels there are and ask all the questions you have! :)


<h2 id="project-setup">Project and Team Setup</h2>

Most of the aspects mentioned here, need to be done at the beginning of the program. Follow these steps and you'll have a great setup for all the activities.

**Github Private Repo**      
A separate Github repo is the best place for your team to organize the issues to work on. We will provide a private repo for each team so you can safely get on with your work.

**Daily Log**      
The daily log is a short list of things you do each day – a summary in the form of bullet points is perfectly fine. The Teams App will be the place to put these. 

Besides keeping your team in the loop, it'll get you familiar with good team practice, and with the high level of transparency that is typical for Open Source development. It will also help you greatly with self-reflection.

We recommend to either combine the daily log with [a morning standup meeting](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html) or fill the log at the end of the way. 

**Time Management**      
Set up a shared calendar for you and your pair and schedule regular, dedicated times for checking on your schedules. Once a week is minimum. Besides recurring events such as communication to your mentor and supervisor, there will be single social events (see below) that shouldn't get lost.

Below you'll see a sample schedule for one week. It serves as a guide and gives you an impression on how to organize your Summer of Code.

**Onboarding Call (Google Hangout)**      
We will start the program with an Onboarding Call, using Google Hangout.

Please make sure you have a google account so you can join the Hangout. If you have any concerns or questions on this, please contact us at [mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com](summer-of-code@railsgirls.com) before the start of the program.

**Twitter**      
Please make sure, you have a Twitter account. It can be either your personal one or a team account which you and your pair will be setting up for the program. 

We will use Twitter for at least the conference ticket raffle and most likely for other social and fun events. Besides, it's a great place to get news and updates from the RGSoC world. 

**Optional: Your Own Team Blog**      
If you are a blogger and write about stuff of your interest anyways, whoy not set up a dedicated RGSoC team blog? Or maybe you wanna start blogging for the Summer? We can only support this. But we also state explicitly, that a blog is not mandatory. 

A blog can be a great place for a more general recap of your project work, or reflections about your learning time and experiences, or reports about events you took part…


<h2 id="social-events">Social Events</h2>      
Rails Girls Summer of Code is a community-based program. And, of course, we want to tell the community what happens here. Here we also need you. Tell people about what you are doing! As a side effect, you can start giving back to the community right away. Spreading the word will get more and more people known to the program and helps us in reaching out to supporters and contributors in the upcoming years. 


**Blog Posts for the RGSoC Blog**      
We ask you as a team to write two blog posts for our central blog. The first will be an introduction (following a questionnaire) and is done at the beginning of July. The second post is due at the end of September and will be a summary of your project experience. You can write in whatever type of post you like, text, images, a video, …

**Fun Events**        
We will come up with a better name for this, promised ;).     
Inbetween, we'll have special events such as gathering a mixtape of all students, having a dedicated day-off, … 


<h2 id="conferences">Community Events and Conferences</h2>

Obviously you should spend the precious work time focussing on your work. But we'd also like you to get in touch with the community vis-a-vis, if possible, so you get a feeling for that vibe, too.

We've gathered more information in the [Conferences](/students/conferences) section.
