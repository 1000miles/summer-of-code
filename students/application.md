<h2 id="1">Who Is Eligible To Apply?</h2>

Applications to Rails Girls Summer of Code are open to anyone who:

* Self-identifies as female and/or has experiences being socialized as female.
  No-one is excluded from applying on the basis of gender, but people who
  self-identify as female, or have experiences being socialized as female, are
  given preference during selection
* Has attended one or more **<a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> workshop** or has been involved in other similar initiatives (e.g. RailsBridge, Women Who Code, Black Girls Code...) that started their interest in programming.
* Has significantly expanded their programming skills after a workshop in a
  study group, or independently, by working on a suitable project. **We recommend
  a year of training or more**. We will ask for coding examples.
* Can spend 3 months of their summer working **fulltime** on their Open Source project of
  choice.

You **do** not have to be a student at a University to apply, and there are
certainly no degree or age limitations.

<h2 id="2">What Do You Need To Apply?</h2>

<h3 id="3">Coaches</h3>

Coaches are developers who are (preferably) based in the same city as you, and
can help you accomplish your project tasks. You are not limited to how many
coaches you can use during your project,  but you must have access to someone
who can help you with your project throughout the summer, preferably for at
least a few hours a day. Be specific about the days and hours when your coaches
can help you. A roster of which coach will help on which days, is favorable for
your application. Discuss your project with your coaches and make sure they can
support you.

Finding a coach in your geographic location is advisable. Better yet, being
able to work with them in their office. Having someone to sit down and
troubleshoot with at regular intervals will increase your odds of having a
successful and enjoyable project. Coaches are volunteers, and cannot expect any
reimbursement from RGSoC.

<h3 id="4">Another student to pair with</h3>

Finding a pair before lodging your application is extremely advisable. If you
lodge your application as a one-person team, your application will hold less
weight than those who have a two-person team application. Finding a pair in
your geographic region is also preferable, and will be looked upon favorably
during the selection process.

Remote and/or one-person teams will not be excluded, but their applications
must be outstanding. If you are working in a remote team, you will need to
provide exceptionally good evidence as to why you will make a good team. For
example, if a remote team know each other well and have already trained working
remotely on an existing project, their application will be looked on more
favorably.

It is not a requirement to find a pair before applying, but you will need to
provide extremely good proof of your competencies to work on a project alone.
If you intend to form a team, do not lodge your application until you have
found your pair.

Make sure both you and your pair understand the requirements of the project,
and could potentially work well together. There is nothing more detrimental to
project success than an unhappy or unproductive team mate.

For more advice on finding a team mate and coach, take a look at the 'How to'
article on the subject and the bottom of this page.

<h3 id="5">A place to work</h3>

Working at a desk next to your coach(es) is a great scenario. If you have
access to a team of coaches who can share the load it is ideal. You will need
an environment conducive to dedicating yourself to your project for 3 months.
This could be your home, a co-working space, or your current work office. As
long as you are safe and productive, you can choose where you will work.

<h3 id="6">A project plan</h3>

A project can include anything that helps open source like bug fixing,
implementing small features, improving documentation, design, etc. The project
will allow a student to both apply her current experience and grow with the
challenge. The learning target, and goal, of the project is to turn yourself,
as a Ruby newcomer, into a core contributor to your selected open source
project. The ideal project should be:

* considered a valuable, significant contribution to Open Source
* simple enough that a beginner will be able to complete it in a time frame of
  three months or less.

Projects should have an end goal, as well as several subordinate goals and
milestones that participants can use to track their progress against.

Please meet with your coach and pair to discuss what project you are looking to
undertake. Meeting with your coach is a great way to understand if your goals
are realistic, and what your project plan will look like.

Together with you and your pair, coaches should be able to:

* talk to you both about your level of your expertise,
* make recommendations about open source projects that you could contribute to,
  and
* help you create as detailed a project plan as possible for your 3-month SoC
  project.

If you are interested in more than one project, you can lodge an application
for every project you want to work on, but each application must be unique to
that project.

You should find a mentor who can act as an expert to consult on the project,
and give general directions and feedback. Mentors are intimately knowledgeable
about the open source project you intend to work on, while coaches are working
closely with you and your pair. You can find a project mentor through your
coach, or through the community, by contacting project maintainers directly.
Mentors may even put forward ideas for teams to work on. If you have trouble
finding a mentor, write as an email, and we'll see if we can help.

<h2 id="7">How to Find Team Pair and Coaches</h2>

The best starting point for finding a pair and coaches is to contact your local
<a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls chapter</a>, and development
communities such as your local Ruby group. This will also be a good starting
point for people in need of guidance on their projects.

If you have no luck, or live in an area where there is no Rails Girls chapter,
ask on the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rails-girls-summer-of-code-community">Rails Girls Summer of Code community mailing list</a>,
or via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/railsgirlsoc">@RailsGirlsSoC</a> on Twitter.

If you already have a good project plan, and are looking for a coach, a team
member, and/or a work space for you project, don't lodge your application
before you have found them. If you need help finding them, contact us before
you apply, otherwise we will consider your application as it stands. Take a
look at this <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/where-to-start/">blog post</a>
outlining some creative ways past teams have found coaches, mentors, and
workplaces for the summer.

<h2 id="8">How to find a Project</h2>

Donâ€™t know where to start?  We are collecting project proposals for 2014 in
<a href="https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects/issues">this repository</a>.

Talk to your coaches and other people of your local Rails Girls community -
they will have good ideas. You also can ask on the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rails-girls-summer-of-code-community">Rails Girls Summer of Code community mailing list</a>,
or via @RailsGirlsSoC on Twitter.

Also, here are last year's
<a href="http://2014.teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams">teams and their projects</a>.
and some of
<a href="https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/Projects-2014">last year's project ideas</a>. Here you find <a href="https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/Projects">this year's projects you can apply to</a>. 

If you know an Open Source project you might want to apply to, that is not yet been submitted by their mentor: Please reach out to the mentor and suggest they submit their project to us via the <a href="https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/Projects">Projects Repository</a>.

<h2 id="9">Lodging Your Application</h2>

**Applications for Rails Girls Summer of Code will open March 2015**

Only one application will be accepted per team, per project. 

Your team can lodge one application per project that you have a plan for
working on. You can apply for *one* project and add an alternative within the application. 

If you have any queries about this, please <a href="mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com>"contact us</a> before lodging your applications.

While we will try to connect you with a pair and coaches before you apply. 

<h2 id="10">Selection and Judging</h2>

Applications will be judged on a case-by-case basis by a group of real human
beings in the coding community, on an impartial but realistic basis. We aim for a divers group of teams for 2015 that consist of different countries, projects, backgrounds and skill level (we have some seats reserved for more experienced teams this year). 

Remember: successful applications are **not** "first in best dressed", but are
judged on how well they fulfill eligibility criteria. Take your time to create a
detailed project plan, find your pair, coach and workspace or <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching-company/">coaching company</a>.

Applications lodged after the deadline cannot be considered for judging.

<h2 id="11">Before you apply: Final Steps</h2>
