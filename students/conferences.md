## Go to a conference!

At Rails Girls Summer of Code you work hard and learn new stuff every day, for
3 months, a summer full of love and code.

To make this an even more complete experience for you we'd like you to join a
nice conference:

**Enjoy the great vibe, learn new things from the talks,
meet fantastic people and get to know the lovely community!**

We're already busy getting in touch with conferences in order to support this year's students in joining the community. So stay tuned!
