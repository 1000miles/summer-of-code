## Go to a conference!

Obviously you should spend the precious work time that you have focussing on
your work. But we'd also like you to get in touch with the community vis-a-vis,
if possible, so you get a feeling for that vibe, too.

For example, you can schedule visiting evening events like the local Ruby user
group. User groups usually happen once a month. After the Summer of Code is
over, we recommend to visit a conference that is close to your place.

**Enjoy the great vibe, learn new things from the talks,
meet fantastic people and get to know the lovely community!**

We highly recommend to plan for giving at least a brief lightning talk at any
such event, too, so you get to share the love and practice speaking in front of
a bunch of people :)

Don't feel too scared about presenting your work and experience at such events!
Of course everyone is (seriously, even experienced, seasoned speakers are).

But on the other hand everyone in the community also loves what you are doing
(you can see how this program is being received by looking at the success of
our campaign). And people will love it, hold you in high respect and give their
support if you pluck up your courage to tell them about your experience (even
if just briefly).

If you find a conference that you'd like to visit, then please tell us! We
might know the organizers (or people who know them) and maybe we can sort out
free tickets etc. for you.

We're already busy getting in touch with conferences in order to support this year's students in joining the community. So stay tuned!
