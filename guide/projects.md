<h1>Becoming a Project Mentor</h1>

<p>You’ve heard about the Rails Girls Summer of Code and want to submit your project? Here is some general information that might be helpful for you, as well as guidelines for the submission. Note: we are happy about project submissions in (almost) any language.</p>

<h3 id="q1">What is a good project?</h3>

<p>A good Open Source project to propose for RGSoC 2015:</p>


<ul>
<li>has an open-source license</li>
<li>is established/developed enough to allow collaboration (beyond the set-up phase)</li>
<li>has a dedicated contact person/maintainer</li>
<li>is beginner/junior-friendly (open to newcomers; maintains a inviting, helpful and understanding communication and a non-discriminating environment etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects will be asked to provide a mentor who will act as an expert in the project's domain. However, in their day-to-day work students will be supported by coaches, so the workload for project mentor is limited.</p>

<h3 id="q2">What is a good mentor? What does it entail?</h3>

<p>Mentors/advisors are patient, tolerant and open people! Ideally you are already familiar with the Rails Girls-movement or other newcomer-initiatives.</p>

<p>A mentor is an expert on the proposed project or even the maintainer of it. You are the dedicated contact person for the RGSoC team over the summer.</p>

<p>Being a mentor entails:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing guidance and feedback through the summer concerning your project</li> 
<li>helping the students to apply: help set up a project plan, discussing and suggesting issues/ features to work on</li> 
<li>being in contact with the whole student team throughout the summer (July-September)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="q3">How much time does being a project mentor take?</h3>

<p>The time needed of you during the Summer of Code is dependent on the type of project you are submitting. 

<p>We ask that the project maintainers be available to the students at least two times a month for longer calls; this would mean on average 1-2h/week (including emails and answering questions).</p>

<p>If the learning curve for your project is steep, allow for more time at the beginning of the Summer of Code to help out the students set up the project, get acquainted with the codebase, and answer any general questions they might have.</p>

<p>You will also be expected to be available by email over the whole period of the Summer of Code (July 1st to September 30th) - again, in case the students have any specific questions regarding your project.</p>

<h3 id="q4">Why should I submit my project?</h3>

<p>By submitting your project for the Rails Girls Summer of Code, you are first and foremost allowing your project to be part of a worldwide movement that encourages more diversity in Open Source. As such, you are given the possibility to get diverse feedback and a new outlook on your project - for example, fixes on lacking documentation or an important, missing feature.</p>

<p>Being a project mentor also means welcoming newcomers into the community and, more concretely, having the possibility to tackle some bigger, time-consuming issues (be it bug fixes or the implementation of new features). </p>

<p>Participating would, of course, also give your project a bigger visibility within the community and some new contributors who are very familiar with your project and might be interested in contributing further once the summer is over!</p>

<h3 id="q5">How do I submit my project?</h3>

<p>If you have the feeling that your project is a good fit for RGSoC we are very happy for you to open a new issue in this dedicated <a href ="https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects" target ="_blank">Projects Repository</a>.</p>

<p>In the proposal you are asked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide information on the project (description and background)</li>
<li>suggest issues and features for students to work on which provide a goal that is a valuable contribution to your project</li>
</ul>


<p>A project goal can include anything that helps you: Bug fixing, implementing
small features, refactoring, documentation, design, etc. Anything that allows
the student to both apply her experience and grow with the challenge.</p>

<p>Also, goals can consist of several sub-goals or follow-up goals that can be
adjusted to the progress of the student. Coming up with a good definition might
be hard, taking into account that the student's skills are not yet advanced.
Don't be discouraged by that. We will work together with you in order to figure
out a definition that works well.</p>

<p>To start defining your goal, ask: What can be done to help a Ruby newcomer
become a core contributor on your project? Also, consider this to be a learning
process. Different from GSoC or RSoC the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about
encouraging, motivating, helping newcomers to learn and eventually provide
valuable, significant contributions.</p>

<p>We only want a few Teams applying for the same project, so we’d suggest you to only accept 2-3 teams applying for your project. These teams you’ll advise and help with the application process. If you had enough applicants, please lock the GitHub issue as a sign for other applicants not to contact you anymore.</p>

<p>If your project is chosen by applicants you need to sign in as a mentor in our <a href="http://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org" target="_blank">Teams App</a> in order to verify the student’s application for your project. </p>

<h3 id="q6">I'd like to submit my project, but what if I have no time to be a mentor?</h3>

<p>We want to make this clear: for a project to be considered for the program, the students <b>must</b> have someone they can rely on to answer their project-specific questions. As such, we feel that a core contributor of the project fits this role of "project mentor" best.</p>
<p>However we understand that the maintainers of some established projects have busy schedules; whch is why we encourage you to ask the community for help! If there are other regular and motivated contributors to your project who you think fit the profile of a good mentor and whom you trust to be experts on the subject, please ask them if they would be interested in being project mentors. If that doesn't work, get in touch with us directly - maybe we can find a solution together.</p>
