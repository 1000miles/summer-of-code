## Sponsorship Packages & Guidelines

Rails Girls Summer of Code subsidises programming newcomers to learn and work
on Open Source projects from July to September each year, and endows accepted
students with a monthly stipend, for three months.

By providing this stipend, we enable students to dedicate themselves to their
Open Source learning projects full-time. As a sponsor, you are a crucial part of
providing the Summer of Code subsidies. Your sponsorship will enter a budget
pool, from which the selected students will be paid.

Sponsoring Rails Girls Summer of Code will make you feel warmer than a
unicorn's belly, and fuzzier than the fuzziest tribble! But in all
seriousness, warm fuzzies are just one nice side-effect you get.

During and even after the program you may experience severe amounts of organic
PR and marketing without having to lift a finger. The program sees a huge
amount of publicity from our student teams, coaches and organisers: be it on
Twitter, Facebook, blogs or at conferences and local developers meet ups. It’s
a great blend of marketing, and genuinely contributing to the development
community.

<h3>Your swag in student support packages</h3>

If you send us your swag (e.g. stickers, pens, notebooks or other things
that fit nicely with a Summer of Code learning project), we will include
it in a "care package" that will be sent out to each student. Pictures of the
contents of these packages often are tweeted and retweeted a lot.

<h3>Your logo on slides at presentations about RGSoC</h3>

Students are strongly encourage to give full talks or lightning talks at
conferences (many of which donate free tickets for them) as well as local
programming and tech meetups. Students tend to present their projects at these
meetups, and how Summer of Code is helping them do it. Some organizers also
present about the Summer of Code program as a whole.

All people presenting on behalf of or in conjunction with Summer of Code, are
asked to include a slide with all Gold and Platinum sponsors'
logos at the beginning of their presentation.

<h3>Your logo on our Hall of Fame</h3>

Starting this year we will list information about each year's instalment
on a "Hall of Fame" page: Teams participating, projects completed, success
stories to be told. This page will also include each year's Platinum and
bigger sponsors.


<h2 id="guidelines">Sponsorship Guidelines</h2>


Rails Girls Summer of Code is – above all – about people. That’s what we stand by, and it is why we source the scholarship funding from individuals as well as companies.

We are looking for sponsors that can identify with the values of Rails Girls Summer of Code and stand behind our mission to support women in technology and furthermore getting more women into Open Source. We stand for enabling women to join the community, helping to make them visible, speaking up and creating a safe space for them to learn.

The image and track record of the sponsoring companies should not conflict with our values. We can’t know all the facts about a company, but we trust them to be examples of ethical practices, and expect their track record to speak for themselves.

If there are conflicts with our values, we will discuss them on a case by case basis and take action where necessary. We review along the following principles:

+ Does the company reflect the values of Rails Girls and Rails Girls Summer of Code?
+ Do they have a strong track record in supporting women in technology?
+ Do they have a good track record in the community, as a fair employer?
+ Do they have a background of supporting Rails Girls events and/or groups before, during or after workshops?
+ Does the company show a sincere and sustainable effort in handling and overcoming a situation which conflicts with our values?

This can also mean rejecting a company as a sponsor, as we have done before and might do in the future.
